# wwe-title

This project is meant to be an API for WWE Championship titles. For each title,
there is a history of wrestlers who have won, lost, or even had their titles
revoked from them. It includes the years they've held the title as well who they
won over or lost to in order to obtain/lose that championship title. Heck, even
the pay-per-view or show this happened is included!

The WWE Title API simply makes JSON responses out of all these events.

TODOs:
* [x] Preload data
* [x] Show example requests
* [x] Use API in future projects as a dependency
